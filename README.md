# # Code Refactor Starter Code For Horiseo Website Challenge 


## Description

The goal of this challenge was to refactor/improve the existing code of the given Horiseo wep-page without changing any of the current functions. Through-out this assignment I was able to combine certain Class and id elements in the style.css document to help cut down lines and not only that but I was able change the html <div> tags to more presices and accurate semantic tags for each main section located in the index.html. Finally I was able to add an alt reference for each of the image assets used in this challenge.

## Installation

To install my code you can use clone the repo using either the HTML or ssh key to add to your local machine.

## Usage

The main usage of this project is to teach myself and others how to accuratly use proper semantic tags to help better navigate my html code, provide an alt to img assets, and to help combine certain codes in the Style.css document.
